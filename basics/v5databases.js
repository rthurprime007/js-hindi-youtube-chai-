//to find the string type example 
console.log(typeof "javad") //if you execute it then it will tell you its a (string)
console.log(typeof age) // executing it will give you (number)
// for console.log(typeof null) the terminal will give object(debateable)(interview questation)
//for console.log (typeof undefined ) the terminal will give undefined

// comparison answer will be in boolean true or false
//console.log(2>1);
//console.log(2<1)
//console.log(2 >= 1) more than equal to
//console.log(2==1) is equals to
//console.log(2!=1) not equal to

//same goes for strings but what will happen if there are different data types



//console.log(null>0)      false 
//console.log(null == 0)   false
//console.log(null >= 0)   true (the reason is that an equality check == and comparisons > , < , >= , <= works differentley)
//omparisons convert null to a number , treating it a 0 thats why null >=0 is true while null >0 is false

//console.log(undefined == 0) false
//console.log(undefined > 0)   false
//console.log(undefined < 0)  false

//(from line 12 to 19 these are very confusing so revise )



//***strict check ******
// (===) = strict check

console.log("2" == 2)   // == only check numbers
console.log("2" === 2)  // === check numbers with datatype
